# Cell_Segmentation_U-Net
A Tensorflow/Keras project to segment "Living cell" and "Dead cell" from microscope images!

# How
In this study, the intricate world of cell image segmentation was extensively examined, with a particular focus on the application of the U-Net model. unravelling the complexities of image segmentation and highlighted its unique natureâ€”a combination of classification and localization tasks.

# Usage
Run 'train_model.py', which will train the model on the dataset, and produce 'cell_segmentation_model_improved.h5'
